# 100 Days of Python Programming Challenge

Welcome to my repository where I aim to undertake a 100-day journey in learning Python. This project is inspired by the idea of committing to something continuously for a significant number of days to form a habit. I am committing to this challenge to improve my Python programming skills and create a strong foundation in Python. The main goal here is to learn Python through a practical, hands-on approach.

## Repository Structure

This repository consists of:

- **Daily Folders**: Each day's Python challenges will be stored in separate folders (Day1, Day2...Day100), which will contain the Python scripts that I wrote for that day's challenge.

- **Notebooks**: For complex tasks or tasks involving multiple steps, I will use Jupyter notebooks which allow me to write code, add descriptive text, and visualize data all in one place.

- **Resources**: All extra learning materials, cheat sheets, etc. I use during this journey.

## The Challenge

The challenge is simple:

- Code minimum for an hour every day for the next 100 days.

- Every day, select a new problem to solve or continue working on a larger project, breaking it down into manageable tasks.

- Push code to Github every day so that anyone can see my progress.

## Tracking Progress

Below is a table that I will use to track my progress throughout this journey. I will update this table daily.
